# humidityController
Arduino based humidity controller with DTH11 sensor 

This uses a Arduino Uno Controller which monitors Humidity from DTH11 sensor and switches ON/OFF humidifier with the help of a  Servo motor.

I have used Interrupts to set desired Maximum and Minimum Humidity levels at any point.

Also a simple loop structure to display the time, but the time module is not accurate yet.
